1. Once redis is installed, go to the location where redis.conf is located:
  /Ankit/redis_installation/redis-stable/
  Make the regular changes like 
  IP
  protected-mode no
  
2. In the redis.conf file find the line that starts with "save"
  Go to section #### SNAPSHOTING ######
    dir /Ankit/redis_installation/
    save 60 5          => This means if in the last 60 seconds, 5 writes/updates have happened, write the snapshot to disk
  
3. Save the redis.conf file and start redis server
  redis-server redis.conf
  
4. Start 2 more terminals
  a. to connect to cli
  b. to observer files
  
  Keep all 3 terminals side by side
  
5. start setting keys and see the logs

  CASE1: save command triggers from conf file
    setting 4 keys will not trigger the snapshot
    the moment we set 5th key, snapshot process will start
    
    Note: that its not just every 60 sec, its every 60 sec only if atleast 5 writes/updates have happended
    1361:M 13 Jan 2023 08:53:06.968 * 5 changes in 60 seconds. Saving...
    1361:M 13 Jan 2023 08:53:06.969 * Background saving started by pid 1419
    1419:C 13 Jan 2023 08:53:07.041 * DB saved on disk
    1419:C 13 Jan 2023 08:53:07.041 * Fork CoW for RDB: current 0 MB, peak 0 MB, average 0 MB
    1361:M 13 Jan 2023 08:53:07.069 * Background saving terminated with success 


Check for the timestamp of rdb file created at /Ankit/redis_installation/
    
    
  CASE 2: From redis-cli, run
    BGSAVE    => observe that snapshot was triggered
    
  CASE 3: from redis-cli, run
    SAVE -> this blocks all clients and save data to disk
  
  
  CASE 4: from redis-cli, run
    SHUTDOWN command
