2 configs to looks at:
1. diskless data transfer:
  Everytime a replica connects its asks for RDB file
  RDB file is sent to disk - then sent to replica.
  Writing to disk has cost associated to it (has advantage when lot of replica needs to be server and 1 rdb file can be used to send to all replicas)
  
  In case your RDB file creation takes a long time, in your conf file:
    repl-diskless-sync yes        => Means data will be sent directly to replica socket and not master -> disk -> replica
    repl-diskless-sync-delay 5    => Waits for 5 sec before sending in the hope that any other replica might also becomes queued and can be sent parallely, because once begun new replca will demand socket transer again.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
2. Buffer size for replicas:
  client-output-buffer-limit replica 256mb 64mb 60    => means that if replica does not process data fast enough and buffer size exceed 256MB (hard limit) -> master will disconnect
                                                      => or buffer is 64MB for 60 secs
