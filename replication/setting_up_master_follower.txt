Server 1:
1. Go to redis binaries location:
  /Ankit/redis_installation/redis-stable
  
2. Edit redis.conf file to reflect actual hostname instead of localhost/127.0.0.1

3. Start redis
  redis-server redis.conf
  
  
Server 2: OR CREATE a 2nd redis conf file
1. Go to redis binaries location:
  /Ankit/redis_installation/redis-stable
      cp redis.conf redis-replica1.conf
      create a data directory
        mkdir replica1 (in location: /Ankit/redis_installation/redis-stable/)
  Edit the new conf file on following lines:
      port 6380 
      pidfile "/var/run/redis_6380.pid"
      dir "/Ankit/redis_installation/redis-stable/replica1/"
  
  

2. Start redis
   redis-server redis-replica1.conf
  
4. In another putty - connect to 2nd server's redis using redis-cli
  Run command:
    replicaof hostname1 6379
    
    And notice the logs of this replica server in the previous putty
    
    
Notice the logs of both Master and Relica redis-server
Master:
  Replica XXXX:6379 asks for synchronization
  Starting BGSAVE for SYNC with target: replicas sockets
  Background RDB transfer started by pid 13568
  Background RDB transfer terminated with success
  Synchronization with replicaXXXX:6379 succeeded
  
Replica:
   MASTER <-> REPLICA sync started
   MASTER <-> REPLICA sync: receiving streamed RDB from master with EOF to disk
   Discarding previously cached master state
   MASTER <-> REPLICA sync: Flushing old data
   MASTER <-> REPLICA sync: Finished with success
   
   
   
Check the Replication Info of both servers via cli
Master
  redis-cli -h XXXX -p 6379
  info replication
  
  
  Observer follwing:
    role:master
    connected_slaves:1
    master_replid:347b3523492fdea38de3bf713ebdab0a0f05bad5
    
    
 Slave:
  redis-cli -h XXXX -p 6379
  info replication
  
  
  Observer follwing:
    role:salve
    master_host:XXXX
    master_replid:347b3523492fdea38de3bf713ebdab0a0f05bad5

Notice that master_replicaid for both is same


Test if replication is working or not:
1. Set a key on master and see if it reflects in replica
2. Try to set a key in replica node - you should get an error



*********************************
Remove replica
In the replica node connect to redis-cli
Run
  replicaof no one
