1. Overall memory related metrics:
  INFO MEMORY
  
2. Memory usage of particular keys:
  MEMORY USAGE <KEY-NAME>
  
  Note that this gives only the "value's" information, not the key information:
  For example:
  SET NAME Ankit
  and 
  SET NNNNNNNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMMMMMMMMMEEEEEEEEEE Ankit
  will give the same value when we run: MEMORY USAGE NAME or MEMORY USAGE NNNNNNNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMMMMMMMMMEEEEEEEEEE
  
3. Run diagnostics: Will point out to any gaping holes and also suggest solutions if it can.
  MEMORY DOCTOR
  
4. Finding biggest keys in terms of string with largest values, lists with largest no. of items, hashes with largest number of key-value pairs:
  redis-cli -h HOST -p 6379 --bigkeys
