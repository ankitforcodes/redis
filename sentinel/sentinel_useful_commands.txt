1. Connect to a sentinel:
  redis-lci -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5000

2. Find detail info about replica:
  SENTINEL replicas mymaster
  
3. Find detail info about sentinels:
  SENTINEL sentinels mymaster
  
4. Obtaining address of the current master:
  SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster
  
5. Get MASTER details:
  sentinel master mymaster
  
  Some important section of the output:
    num-other-sentinels is 2, so we know the Sentinel already detected two more Sentinels for this master. If you check the logs you'll see the +sentinel events generated
    
    flags is just master. If the master was down we could expect to see s_down or o_down flag as well here
    
    num-slaves is correctly set to 1, so Sentinel also detected that there is an attached replica to our master
