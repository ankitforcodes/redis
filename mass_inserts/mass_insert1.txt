1. Have the CSV file ready that you want to insert in DB
  In our case its at: /Ankit/redis_installation/redis_pipelining
  Filename: country_codes.csv
  
  File structure:
Afghanistan,AF,AFG,004,ISO 3166-2:AF,Asia,Southern Asia,"",142,034,""
Ã…land Islands,AX,ALA,248,ISO 3166-2:AX,Europe,Northern Europe,"",150,154,""
Albania,AL,ALB,008,ISO 3166-2:AL,Europe,Southern Europe,"",150,039,""
Algeria,DZ,DZA,012,ISO 3166-2:DZ,Africa,Northern Africa,"",002,015,""
American Samoa,AS,ASM,016,ISO 3166-2:AS,Oceania,Polynesia,"",009,061,""
Andorra,AD,AND,020,ISO 3166-2:AD,Europe,Southern Europe,"",150,039,""
  
  
2. Our task is to insert this in Redis will Key as Country Code and value as Country name

3. The command that will do it is:
  SET AF Afghanistan
  etc
  
4. We need to prepare a file with redis commands 
  awk -F ',' '{print "SET " $1 " " $2}' country_codes.csv > country_codes_redis.csv
  
  
5. Insert all data sequentially
  cat country_codes_redis.csv | redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379
  
  This will insert data one by one - not what we want
  
6. Insert data using piping
  cat country_codes_redis.csv | redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379 --pipe
  
  
7. As an additional exercise you can introduce some wrong commands in the file and see the response:
  - After the end of bulk transaction redis will tell you how many failed and how many passed
  - It will also give you the error messages for each command that failed, and you can use grep to find it
