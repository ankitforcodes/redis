1. Have the CSV file ready that you want to insert in DB
  In our case its at: /Ankit/redis_installation/data 
  Filename: country_codes.csv
  
  File structure:
  AF,Afghanistan
  AL,Albania
  DZ,Algeria
  AD,Andorra
  AO,Angola
  AI,Anguilla
  AQ,Antarctica
  AR,Argentina
  AM,Armenia
  AW,Aruba
  
  
2. Our task is to insert this in Redis will Key as Country Code and value as Country name

3. The command that will do it is:
  SET AF Afghanistan
  etc
  
4. We need to prepare a file with redis commands 
  awk -F ',' '{print "SET " $1 " " $2}' country_codes.csv > country_codes_redis.csv
  
  
5. Insert all data sequentially
  cat country_codes_redis.csv | redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379
  
  This will insert data one by one - not what we want
  
6. Insert data using piping
  cat country_codes_redis.csv | redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379 --pipe
  
  
7. As an additional exercise you can introduce some wrong commands in the file and see the response:
  - After the end of bulk transaction redis will tell you how many failed and how many passed
  - It will also give you the error messages for each command that failed, and you can use grep to find it
