  debug populate 100
  



1. Default behaviour 
  scan 0
  
  It returns the list of all the keys in the current page and the number of the next page using which we have to make scan call again.
  
2. Call scan again with the next page index returned in the previous scan command
  scan 12

3. Scan and define how many items you want
  scan 0 count 20
  
  
4. Scan and match a pattern
  scan 0 match *2
