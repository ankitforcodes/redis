ACLs can be used to restrict a certain user to perform admin related commands.

STEPS:
1. Set an overall password on your redis:
    requirepass adminpass
    
  This sets a password on overall redis (user mode default)
  This password shoud not be given to any user but only to admins - who will use this mode to perform Admin operations
  
2. Start redis-cli
    redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379
    
    set k1 v1:
      You will get an error: (error) NOAUTH Authentication required.
    
    auth default adminpass
    OK
    
    set k1 v1
    OK
    
3. Create a new user:
     acl setuser nonadminuser on >generalpassword +@all -@dangerous ~*
     
     this creates a new user with:
     USERNAME: nonadminuser
     PASSWORD: generalpassword
     +@all - they can run all commands (permission given to entire command list)
     -@dangerous - but not the commands tagged as dangerous (flush, config set, acl setuser, etc)
     ~* - can run all commands on a key (getting, setting, deleting)
     
4. This username as password can be given to the respective clients
